This project might be a good place to go after reading the official Hugo documentation. Why after, because it does not provide too long explanations of what things _are_ in Hugo. But rather how to _start using_ them. First on basic examples, then getting more practical.
Applying the sea of information from the Hugo documentation should **_bring it all together_**.

#### Attribution

The Knowledge base part is vastly based on the Giraffe Academy tutorial.
And the deployment of this site would not have been possible without the Hextra theme. Which is not only elegant in its implementation but has a user-oriented documentation and a vigilant author who keeps it up to date.
